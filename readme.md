# E-commerce Performance Testing with JMeter

## Project Objective

This project was created to evaluate the performance, scalability, and reliability of an [e-commerce web application](http://www.automationpractice.pl) under different user behaviors. Using **Apache JMeter**, we designed test scenarios that simulate browsing, searching, and purchasing flows, as well as the loading of static resources.

## Tools

* **Apache JMeter** (load testing and performance monitoring)
* **Java** (runtime requirement for JMeter)
* **Listeners** (to collect and visualize metrics)

## Test Scenario (User Flow)

The JMeter test plan (`ecommerce.jmx`) contains multiple thread groups representing different user profiles:

1. **Browsing User** â€“ Navigates through the homepage and product pages.
2. **Searching User** â€“ Uses the search functionality to look up products.
3. **Purchasing User** â€“ Completes the purchase process (search, add to cart, checkout).

## Metrics Collected

* **Response Time (ms)** â€“ How long requests take to complete.
* **Throughput (requests/second)** â€“ Number of requests processed per unit of time.
* **Error Rate (%)** â€“ Percentage of failed requests.
* **Latency (ms)** â€“ Time taken before receiving the first response.
* **Concurrent Users** â€“ Simulated load across different thread groups.

## Reports & Analysis

JMeter listeners and reports provide:

* **Aggregate Report** â€“ Summary of response times, throughput, and error percentages.
* **Response Time Graphs** â€“ Visualizing how response time changes under load.
* **Transaction Controller Results** â€“ Measuring end-to-end user flows.
* **HTML Dashboard Report** â€“ Comprehensive test execution report.

## Repository Structure

```
ðŸ“‚ jmeter-performance-test
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ reports              # Test execution reports (HTML, PNG screenshots)
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ results              # JTL result files generated after execution
 â”£ ðŸ“„ ecommerce.jmx        # JMeter test plan
 â”£ ðŸ“„ README.md            # Project documentation
```

## How to Run the Test

1. **Install JMeter**

   * Download from [https://jmeter.apache.org](https://jmeter.apache.org)
   * Ensure Java is installed and configured.

2. **Clone this Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sergiodealencar/jmeter-performance-test.git
   cd jmeter-performance-test
   ```

3. **Open the Test Plan in JMeter**

   ```bash
   jmeter -t ecommerce.jmx
   ```

4. **Run in GUI Mode (for debugging/visualization)**

   * Launch JMeter GUI
   * Open `ecommerce.jmx`
   * Run the test and observe listeners

5. **Run in Non-GUI Mode (for performance/load testing)**

   ```bash
   jmeter -n -t ecommerce.jmx -l results/test-results.jtl -e -o reports/test-report
   ```

6. **View the Report**

   * Open `reports/test-report/index.html` in your browser

This project demonstrates **load testing best practices** for an e-commerce platform, focusing on **realistic user flows**, **visual reporting**, and **comprehensive performance metrics**.
